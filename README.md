# My config :zap:

This repo represents a collection of different config files for varios Linux programms that I actually use in my development. So you can use that or modify it what ever you want :)

## Distro

I prefer only distros based on Debian. So I actually use [Linux Mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Mint), [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu) or just pure [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian).

## Shell

On servers I prefer to use pure [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)). I don't preinstall any configs, but maybe in the future I will come up with it.


In my own machine I use [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) with [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) framework

```sh

```

## Text editor

For codding - [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

For editing some simple stuff - [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro). For just viewing files - [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

But actually I try to fully migrate to [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
